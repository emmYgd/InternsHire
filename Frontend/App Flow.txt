App flow: 
Employer post job

Intern Search for all jobs posted and apply for their choice... 

Intern Apply for jobs - this depends on a lot of things:
(1) if the Employer has set a test for this job role, the intern has to take the test before being seen by the employer for consideration.
(2) if the Employer has not set any test, then the intern can apply for the job at will and will be seen by the employer
(3) lastly, if the employer has outsourced to the admin, then, the admin will have to set the test and make phone chats on behalf of the employer.. 

Employer View each job posted and the interns that applied to them(including their respective profile).

Employer selects the best candidates (and send chat links to them (whatsapp chat)).
Interns clicks the chat links and it leads them to whatsapp where they can chat employer interested in them.


Other features -- the system should be able to crawl the web itself and look for internship opportunities form certain web pages..
